# EX-XDRiVER Derivative Works and Custom/Fanmade Content Guidelines

These guidelines are subject to change at any time.

We absolutely encourage creating custom/fanmade content. However, we would like to set some general guidelines to follow.

While it is not required, we appreciate it if you link back to either our [website](https://xdrv.team) or the game's [Steam page](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2636020/).

Additionally, if you're making something and want to let us know, feel free to post about it in our community Discord!

## Disallowed Content

- Any content that:
  - Promotes hate speech, violence, threats, or attacks on other people
  - Is sexually explicit, suggestive, or obscene
  - Distributes malware, or abuses security exploits
  - Is paywalled or being sold for monetary value
  - Involves cryptocurrency or any NFT related activity
  - Utilizes, involves or is created with generative AI
- If the content made for another game or product violates the policies, guidelines, or terms of said game or product

Additionally, any merchandise relating to the game being sold in any way must be approved via [email](mailto:contact@xdrv.team) at [contact@xdrv.team](mailto:contact@xdrv.team).

## Custom/Fanmade Charts for other games

If you're working on custom/fanmade charts for other games using the music featured in EX-XDRiVER, we have created a list of all songs approved for use. This list will be periodically updated as we update and add content to the game.

Credit must be given as necessary.

This list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gxUnScr24iShFSdBjL-wL1674XTP6zx8Yg1Jutacxwc).

Additionally, this list also covers songs allowed for use in creating custom charts of existing songs in EX-XDRiVER. While allowed, do not replicate or copy existing charts in the base game.

## Game Modding

Modding is cool, and should be encouraged! Though there have been some cases where people have cheated leaderboard scores, and obtained certain unlockables that shouldn't be obtained at the time, or at all.

**Mods are allowed as long as they don't qualify as a cheat in any way.**

**Cheats are defined as, but not limited to**:
- Tools used for unlocking player icons, flairs, Steam achievements, or in-game charts and songs
- Modifying play data
- Modifying save data (except for settings outside of gameplay)
- Any modification of general gameplay for an advantage (macros, timing windows, autoplay)
- Changing the 'IsModded' game state or anything that utilizes it

**Cheating may result in a ban from the community Discord server, and potentially a ban from the game.** <br>
At minimum, your cheated scores will be removed from leaderboards, and you will be put on a known list of cheaters.

If you're unsure about if your mod qualifies as a cheat or should be adjusted, ask us in Discord.

If you want to mod in something that you think should be in the actual game, or if you've made a mod for the game and would like to contribute to the game in some way, either make a suggestion in our Discord or contact us!

## Datamining

Datamining is generally not allowed. If you need a game asset for any reason, ask us on Discord.
If you're modding and want to ask where something is located, ask us.

While we usually do not include future content in updates, some small things do get added in advance. We ask that discussion of unreleased content stays out of public spaces (i.e. our community Discord).

**Datamining and discussion of unreleased content may result in a ban, depending on the severity, but usually not if it is in good faith.**

## Questions

If you have any questions about anything you're unsure about, or something that isn't completely covered here, ask us on Discord or send us an [email](mailto:contact@xdrv.team) at [contact@xdrv.team](mailto:contact@xdrv.team).
